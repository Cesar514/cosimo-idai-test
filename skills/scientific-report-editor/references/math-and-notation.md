# Math and Notation Standards

## Placement rules
- Use inline math only when short and does not break sentence readability.
- Use standalone display math for derivations, key equations, and optimization statements.

## Consistency rules
- Define every symbol before first use.
- Keep symbol names stable across sections.
- Use one style for vectors/matrices throughout the report.

## Editor behavior
- For DOCX workflows, prefer native equation objects through the document math editor.
- For PDFs, use the report-generation path that preserves mathematical readability and spacing.
- Keep fallback formulas explicit and marked when editor constraints force plain-text rendering.

## Quality checks
- Verify spacing around symbols and operators.
- Verify equation references and numbering where needed.
- Verify explanatory text before and after every major formula.
