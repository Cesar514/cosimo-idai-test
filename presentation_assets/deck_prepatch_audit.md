Style notes (concise):
- Slide 19: tonal shift ("Why This Is Marvelous") vs otherwise technical/formal naming.
- Slide 20 and 22: numbered `1)` list style differs from dominant bullet style.
- Slide 21: title casing drift (`skills.md` lowercase at title start).
- Slides 37, 39, 40: dark framed screenshot style contrasts with thin-line icon style used in other image slides.
- Slide 41: intentionally informal/comedic title and voice vs surrounding slides.

Summary counts:
- Slides missing images: `33 / 42`
- Slides missing references footer: `42 / 42`
- Slides likely overcrowded: `19 / 42`
- Slides with obvious style inconsistencies: `8 / 42`
