# Project Overview

## What Is `cosimi-idai-test`?

`cosimi-idai-test` is a Python-first workspace for robotics maze planning experiments, simulation execution, benchmarking, and presentation artifact production.

## Core Purpose

- Run reproducible maze simulations from a single CLI/runtime entrypoint.
- Compare baseline and alternative planners under shared benchmark conditions.
- Produce benchmark and screenshot artifacts consumed by deck tooling.
- Maintain traceable coordination/reporting outputs for agent-run tasks.

## Technology Stack

- `Language`: Python 3.11
- `Environment`: Pixi workspace (`pixi.toml` at repo root)
- `Core runtime libs`: `numpy`, `pybullet`, `mujoco`, `Pillow`
- `Testing`: `pytest`
- `Presentation tooling`: `python-pptx`

## Key Features

- Deterministic maze generation (`backtracker`, `prim`) with seed-based reproducibility.
- Planner registry in `planners.py` with baseline planners (`astar`, `dijkstra`, `bfs`, `greedy_best_first`) and alias mapping.
- Additional alternative planners in `src/alt_planners/` (`r1` through `r13`, with `r10` as research notes).
- Runtime backend selection (`auto`, `pybullet`, `mujoco`) with graceful fallback.
- Benchmark ranking policy based on success rate, comparable solve time/path, expansions, and mean solve time.

## Getting Started

```bash
pixi install
pixi run sim
pixi run benchmark
```

For direct custom runs (including headless variants), use:

```bash
python scripts/sim_runner.py --planner astar --episodes 3 --maze-size 15 --seed 42
```

## Architecture Summary

The system is a modular monolith with four major concerns:

- Runtime orchestration (`scripts/sim_runner.py`, `robotics_maze/src/main.py`)
- Planning and maze domain logic (`maze.py`, `planners.py`, `alt_planners/`, `heuristics.py`)
- Simulation and control (`sim.py`, `robot.py`, `geometry.py`)
- Evaluation and artifact production (`benchmark.py`, screenshot scripts, PPT scripts)
