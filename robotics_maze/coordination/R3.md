# R3 Coordination Log

## Scope Ownership
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r3_theta_star.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R3_theta_star.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R3.md`

## Status
- Completed: Theta* research note + runnable planner implementation.
- Completed: `plan_theta_star(grid, start, goal)` for 8-connected occupancy grid.
- Completed: path and metrics return contract.

## Implementation Notes
- Planner implements Theta* parent-lifting with cached LOS checks.
- LOS uses supercover traversal plus diagonal pinch rejection.
- Returns `(path, metrics)` where path is `(row, col)` list and metrics include runtime, expansions, LOS counters, and smoothing counters.

## Assumptions Recorded
- Falsy cell => free, truthy => blocked.
- Rectangular grid, point-robot geometry, out-of-bounds treated as blocked.
- Euclidean costs with diagonal motion enabled.

## Integration Considerations
- If upstream uses a different blocked-cell convention, adapt `_is_blocked`.
- If a robot footprint is required, add map inflation before planning.
