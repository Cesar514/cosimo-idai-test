# L1 Session Logger Notes

## Running Note
- Initialized and maintain `session_event_log.csv` as append-only coordination history.
- Backfilled visible robotics coordination events from `TASK_BOARD.md`, `S1.md`, and available `B*.md`/`R*.md` logs.
- Appended user-provided subagent completion events with provided IDs and details.

## Current Logging Mode
- New events are appended as new CSV rows only.
- Unknown timestamps/IDs remain explicitly marked as `unknown` (or `n/a` where appropriate).

## Readiness
L1 is ready for incremental append updates from follow-up messages.
