# R6 Coordination Log

## Scope Ownership
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r6_lpa_star.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R6_lpa_star.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R6.md`

## Status
- Completed: research + runnable LPA\* candidate + documentation.

## Deliverable
- Added `plan_lpa_star(grid, start, goal)` returning `(path, metrics)`.
- Path format: list of `(row, col)` from start to goal (inclusive), empty if no path.
- Metrics include incremental behavior and runtime counters:
  - `status`, `reused_tree`, `full_reset`, `reset_reason`
  - `changed_cells`, `expanded_nodes`
  - `queue_pushes`, `queue_pops`
  - `path_cost`, `path_length`, `time_ms`

## Implementation Notes
- Incremental mode is active when start/goal and grid shape remain unchanged.
- Occupancy diffs update only affected vertices (`changed cells + neighbors`) before `compute_shortest_path`.
- If endpoints or shape change, planner resets cleanly (scoped approximation rather than partial carryover).

## Handoff Notes
- Integrators can call `plan_lpa_star` repeatedly in a loop to benchmark dynamic replanning.
- For moving-start workloads, next extension is D\* Lite-style start-motion handling.
