# R1 Integration Notes: Weighted A*

## Delivered Planner
- File: `src/alt_planners/r1_weighted_astar.py`
- Function: `plan_weighted_astar(grid, start, goal, weight=1.5)`

## Signature / Return Compatibility
Recommended planner contract for integration:

`planner(grid, start, goal, **kwargs) -> (path, metrics)`

R1 implementation returns:
- `path`: `List[Tuple[int, int]]` from start to goal (empty list if unreachable)
- `metrics`: `Dict[str, float]` with:
  - `runtime_ms`
  - `expanded_nodes`
  - `path_cost` (`inf` if unreachable)

This is drop-in compatible with benchmark pipelines expecting `path + metrics` outputs.

## Grid Assumptions
- 2D rectangular grid.
- 4-connected motion (up/down/left/right).
- Free cells: `0`.
- Blocked cells: non-zero numeric values or wall symbols (`#`, `X`, `@`, `W`).

## Complexity + Performance Note
- Worst-case time: `O(E log V)`, space: `O(V)`.
- Typically outperforms A* in runtime when slight suboptimality is acceptable, especially on large/open mazes.
