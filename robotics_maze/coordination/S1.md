# S1 Supervisor Dashboard

## Pass
- Timestamp: 2026-02-26 19:40:02 GMT
- Scan scope: `robotics_maze/coordination/B*.md`, `robotics_maze/coordination/R*.md`
- Files found: none

## Status
- Done: none reported
- In-progress: none reported
- Blocker: missing status logs for `B1..B6` and `R1..R10`

## Integration Order (Recommended)
1. B1 scaffold/CLI/deps
2. B5 URDF/assets setup
3. B2 maze generation + wall conversion
4. B3 simulation loop + robot control
5. B4 planner interface + A* baseline
6. B6 benchmark harness + reporting/tests
7. R1..R10 planner candidates, integrated one-by-one behind B4 interface

## Risk Notes
- Coordination risk: no build/research logs yet, so true progress is unobservable.
- Interface risk: planner/map/sim contracts may drift without an early shared API spec.
- Dependency risk: PyBullet + URDF paths on macOS may fail if asset layout is inconsistent.
- Benchmark risk: without deterministic seeds and common metrics, planner comparisons will be noisy.

## Next Pass Checks
- Re-scan for newly created `B*.md` and `R*.md`.
- Move agents from blocker to in-progress/done as logs appear.
- Re-rank integration order based on actual completion evidence and blockers.
