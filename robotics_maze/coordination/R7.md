# R7 Status Log

## Timestamp
2026-02-26

## Scope Owned
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r7_beam_search.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R7_beam_search.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R7.md`

## Completed
- Researched Beam Search for approximate grid pathfinding.
- Implemented `plan_beam_search(grid, start, goal, beam_width=32)`.
- Added deterministic 4-neighbor expansion with Manhattan heuristic ranking.
- Implemented path reconstruction and metrics return tuple `(path, metrics)`.
- Documented speed/optimality tradeoff and complexity notes.

## API Contract
- Input:
  - `grid`: rectangular 2D occupancy grid (`0` free, non-zero blocked)
  - `start`, `goal`: `(row, col)`
  - `beam_width`: integer >= 1
- Output:
  - `path`: `List[(row, col)]` or `[]` if not found
  - `metrics`: dict with `found`, `path_length`, `runtime_ms`, search counters,
    `beam_width`, `failure_reason`, and `optimality_guaranteed=False`

## Tradeoff Summary
- Lower `beam_width` => faster, less memory, more pruning risk.
- Higher `beam_width` => better path quality/success, higher cost.
- Beam search is fast and practical but not optimality-guaranteed.
