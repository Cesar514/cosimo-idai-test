# Task 26/36 Report - Post-2021 Literature Owner

Date: 2026-02-26

## Ownership Files
- `robotics_maze/research/post_2021_methods.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/task26_post2021.md`

## Completion Status
- Created `robotics_maze/research/post_2021_methods.md` from scratch.
- Compiled **24** references (all **2022+**) relevant to maze/mobile robotics planning alternatives to vanilla A*.
- Added a strict **4-sentence justification** for every reference.

## Citation Verification Method
- DOI-based citations were metadata-checked against Crossref (`api.crossref.org`).
- arXiv citations were metadata-checked against arXiv API (`export.arxiv.org/api/query`).
- Citation fields normalized: title, authors, year, venue/source, and canonical URL/DOI.

## Citation Quality Notes

### Quality rubric
- **A**: Peer-reviewed with DOI in strong robotics/AI/control venues (e.g., RAS, ESWA, EAAI, KBS, Mechatronics, Scientific Reports).
- **B**: Peer-reviewed with DOI but typically application-focused or less selective venues (including several MDPI journals).
- **C**: arXiv preprints (not final archival versions), even when acceptance is noted in manuscript comments.

### Distribution across 24 references
- **A-level**: 12
- **B-level**: 7
- **C-level**: 5

### Specific risk flags
- `C` references (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 24 in the research doc) are preprints; treat empirical claims as provisional until final archival versions are cited.
- Several `B` references are from MDPI journals (`Sensors`, `Machines`, `Applied Sciences`, `Electronics`); they are peer-reviewed but quality can be heterogeneous across special issues.
- High-confidence anchors for core claims include DOI-backed papers in `Robotics and Autonomous Systems`, `Expert Systems with Applications`, `Engineering Applications of AI`, `Knowledge-Based Systems`, and `Mechatronics`.

## Deliverable Check
- Requirement `>=20` references: **satisfied (24)**.
- Requirement `post-2021`: **satisfied (all 2022-2026)**.
- Requirement `4-sentence justification each`: **satisfied**.
