# Task 30/36 - Subscription/Pricing Notes

Date: 2026-02-26

## Ownership
- `presentation_assets/subscription_pricing_notes.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/task30_pricing.md`

## Objective
Draft subscription and local-model cost comparison notes for slides `15`-`16`, with an explicit date stamp and clear caveats to re-verify pricing before presenting.

## What I changed
- Created `presentation_assets/subscription_pricing_notes.md`.
- Added explicit date stamp: `2026-02-26`.
- Added a mandatory caveat section stating that pricing/plan details must be re-validated on presentation day.
- Added source links used for day-of re-check:
  - OpenAI pricing docs
  - GitHub Copilot subscription plans docs
  - Google developer plans/pricing page
- Added a comparison table: hosted subscriptions/APIs vs local model stack.
- Added an assumption-based cost model and break-even example for discussion when exact live pricing is unavailable.
- Added slide-specific speaking notes and a short presenter recheck checklist (`T-24h`, `T-1h`).

## Notes
- The assumption model is intentionally labeled as non-authoritative so it does not imply vendor-official pricing.
- No files outside ownership scope were modified.
