## Deliverables Completed

1. Created `docs/generated/DELIVERY_SYNTHESIS.md` with:
   - a unified smart-docs + frontend-design narrative
   - a section-to-slide crosswalk table (content anchors to templates/concepts)
   - integration rules for readability, visual discipline, and attribution
   - a short delivery-ready checklist
2. Created this owner report for traceability.

## Notes

- Scope was limited to owned files only.
- No implementation/runtime code was modified.
