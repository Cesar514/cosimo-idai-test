# README Root Refresh

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-27
- Scope: `README.md`

Updated the root README to match the current repo state: refreshed the date, kept only current root Pixi tasks (`sim`, `benchmark`), aligned benchmark examples with defaults (`--mazes 50`, `--seed 7`), and removed stale benchmark command values (old `--mazes 30` example). The content was tightened to a concise quick-start/run/validation reference.
