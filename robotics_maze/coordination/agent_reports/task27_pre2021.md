# Task 27/36 - Pre-2021 Literature Owner Report

Date: 2026-02-26

## Ownership
- `robotics_maze/research/pre_2021_methods.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/task27_pre2021.md`

## Deliverable Summary
- Created `robotics_maze/research/pre_2021_methods.md` with **21** references relevant to maze/mobile-robot planning alternatives to vanilla A*.
- Enforced pre-2021 scope (`year <= 2020`) across all included references.
- Added a fixed **4-sentence justification** for every reference using the required structure:
  - contribution
  - relevance
  - limitation
  - implementation-priority impact

## Citation Quality Notes

### Quality Tiers
- **Tier A (13/21):** DOI-backed journal/conference citations with stable bibliographic anchors.
- **Tier B (7/21):** Official institutional or proceedings pages without DOI links in the citation entry.
- **Tier C (1/21):** Preprint-only citation (arXiv) used for pre-2021 coverage completeness.

### Weak/Follow-up Items
- `#5`, `#9`, `#11`, `#13`, and `#15` use institutional-hosted publication pages (RI/Stanford/idm-lab) rather than DOI-first links.
- `#6` and `#8` are official proceedings pages (AAAI/NIPS archive) but still not DOI-normalized in the current entry format.
- `#21` (AIT*) is preprint-only and should be replaced with a peer-reviewed archival version if the project requires strictly non-preprint evidence.
- If stricter citation policy is needed, next pass should normalize all possible entries to DOI or publisher landing pages and add access-date stamps.

## Validation Checks
- Reference count (`>=20`): **Pass**
- Year constraint (pre-2021): **Pass**
- 4-sentence justification per reference: **Pass**
- Citation quality notes included in report: **Pass**
