# Task 29/36 - Agent Types/Depth Explainer

Date: 2026-02-26

## Ownership
- `presentation_assets/agent_types_depth.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/task29_agent_types.md`

## Goal
Create a concise explainer for Codex agent types, spawn depth, and why depth improves orchestration, suitable for slide integration.

## What I changed
- Created `presentation_assets/agent_types_depth.md` with:
  - a compact agent type table (`default`, `worker`, `explorer`, `awaiter`)
  - a clear depth model (depth 0, depth 1, depth 2+)
  - practical depth heuristics for real orchestration
  - explicit benefits of depth control
  - a final "slide-ready copy" section for direct deck insertion
- Added this task report for coordination handoff.

## Integration notes
- Content aligns with existing deck narrative around:
  - Slide 18: spawn tree and max depth
  - Slide 19: agent types and orchestration value
- Wording is intentionally short and presentation-friendly.

## Scope check
- No files outside the ownership scope were modified.
