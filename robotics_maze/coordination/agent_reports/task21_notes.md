# Task 21 Notes - Speaker Notes Editor

Date: 2026-02-26
Owner scope:
- `presentation_assets/speaker_notes.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/task21_notes.md`

## Objective
Tighten narrative flow for the multi-agent presentation while keeping notes aligned with the current `agents.pptx` slide set.

## What I changed
- Rewrote `presentation_assets/speaker_notes.md` with a tighter, presentation-ready talk track.
- Kept all `41` slide sections and exact slide titles to preserve one-to-one mapping with deck order.
- Reduced repetitive phrasing and added a consistent narrative spine:
  - role clarity
  - guarded execution
  - artifact-backed validation
- Strengthened transitions across sections (tooling -> orchestration -> skills -> governance -> demo -> robotics risk).

## Alignment verification
- Verified slide count and titles directly from `agents.pptx` using `python3` + `python-pptx`.
- Confirmation result: `41` slides, titles match the headings in `speaker_notes.md`.

## Notes
- No files outside ownership scope were modified.
- No deck structure changes were made; this task only polished speaker notes and documented the update.
