# Backlog Summary Refresh Report

Date: 2026-02-27 (UTC)
Owner file updated: `robotics_maze/coordination/BACKLOG_SUMMARY.md`

## Scope Completed
- Preserved the existing issue coverage for `#1`, `#2`, `#5`, and `#6`.
- Added a new section for newly created issues `#9` through `#18`.
- Included one-line purpose summaries for each new issue.
- Added explicit prioritization tiers and a dependency-aware execution order.

## Newly Included Issues
- `#9` Freeze benchmark snapshot for paper reproducibility.
- `#10` Add repeated-run timing protocol and rank-stability analysis.
- `#11` Verify 2021+ bibliography metadata and DOI correctness.
- `#12` Script inferential table generation from benchmark CSV.
- `#13` Evaluate PyBullet vs MuJoCo parity on matched episodes.
- `#14` Add dynamic-obstacle benchmark extension and replanning metrics.
- `#15` Add URDF fallback robustness tests and structured diagnostics.
- `#16` Enforce canonical 12-planner benchmark contract in CI.
- `#17` Final novelty/framing editorial pass for submission.
- `#18` Replace figures with publication-grade scripted plotting.

## Prioritization Added
- `P0`: `#9`, `#10`, `#12`, `#16` (reproducibility and benchmark contract first)
- `P1`: `#13`, `#15`, `#14` (runtime/backend robustness next)
- `P2`: `#11`, `#18`, `#17` (submission polish after artifact lock)

## Source Basis
- GitHub issue metadata for `Cesar514/cosimo-idai-test` issues `#9`-`#18`.
