# Task 28/36 - GitHub Issue Templates Owner

- Date (UTC): 2026-02-26
- Ownership: `robotics_maze/research/github_issue_templates.md`, `robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/task28_issue_templates.md`
- Goal: Draft two ready-to-post GitHub issue templates for reference verification:
  1. post-2021 refs verification
  2. pre-2021 refs verification

## Deliverables Completed

1. Created `robotics_maze/research/github_issue_templates.md` with two copy/paste issue bodies.
2. Added a post-2021 template requiring:
   - retained references `>= 20`
   - year filter `>= 2021`
   - exactly 4-sentence `Justification`
3. Added a pre-2021 template requiring:
   - retained references `>= 20`
   - year filter `< 2021`
   - exactly 4-sentence `Justification`
4. Included execution checklists and acceptance criteria in both templates.

## Compliance Notes

- Edited only owned files listed in task instructions.
- Did not touch unrelated files despite concurrent agent activity.
- Both templates are formatted as ready-to-post issue bodies with explicit title + body blocks.
