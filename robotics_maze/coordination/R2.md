# R2 Coordination Log

## Scope
Owned files only:
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r2_bidirectional_astar.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R2_bidirectional_astar.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R2.md`

## Completed
1. Researched Bidirectional A* for 2D grid mazes.
2. Implemented runnable `plan_bidirectional_astar(grid, start, goal)`.
3. Function now returns `(path, metrics)`.
4. Documented practical tradeoffs and failure modes.

## Planner Interface
```python
path, metrics = plan_bidirectional_astar(grid, start, goal)
```

`metrics` includes:
- `status` (`success`, `no_path`, or input-validation statuses)
- `path_length`, `path_cost`
- `nodes_expanded_forward`, `nodes_expanded_backward`, `nodes_expanded_total`
- `nodes_generated`
- `runtime_ms`
- `meeting_bridge` (for successful runs)

## Notes for Integration
- Assumes 4-connected unit-cost motion.
- Best fit for occupancy grids where free cells are `0`.
- Includes simple string-cell support (`"."`, `" "`, `"S"`, `"G"`, `"0"` as free).
