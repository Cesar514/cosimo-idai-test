# B2 Progress Log: Maze Math + 3D Wall Conversion

## Status
- Completed deterministic maze generation in `src/maze.py`.
- Added two algorithms: recursive backtracker and optional randomized Prim variant.
- Enforced solvability checks after generation.
- Added deterministic `start` and center `goal` coordinate support.
- Exposed `create_maze_generator()` integration factory for CLI auto-loading.
- Implemented wall-to-3D obstacle conversion utilities in `src/geometry.py`.
- Added full docstrings and type hints across both modules.

## Implementation Notes
- Maze representation uses explicit horizontal/vertical wall grids.
- Generation uses seeded RNG (`random.Random(seed)`) for deterministic output.
- Solvability validation uses BFS shortest-path checks.
- 3D conversion outputs obstacle boxes as `(position, dimensions)` and supports
  collinear wall merging to reduce object count.

## Validation
- Ran local sanity checks with `python3`:
  - Deterministic backtracker output confirmed for repeated `seed=42`.
  - Solvability confirmed for backtracker and Prim variants.
  - Start/goal coordinates confirmed as `(0, 0)` and center `(5, 4)` for a `10x8` maze.
  - Wall-to-box conversion returned non-empty output and serializable
    `(position, dimensions)` records.
