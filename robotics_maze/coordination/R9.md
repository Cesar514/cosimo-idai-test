# R9 Status Log

## Completed
- Implemented `plan_bidirectional_bfs(grid, start, goal)` in `src/alt_planners/r9_bidirectional_bfs.py`.
- Added research notes in `research/R9_bidirectional_bfs.md`.

## Planner Contract
- Signature: `plan_bidirectional_bfs(grid, start, goal) -> (path, metrics)`
- Path: shortest 4-connected unit-cost path from `start` to `goal` (inclusive), or `[]` on failure.
- Status values:
  - `ok`
  - `no_path`
  - `invalid_input`

## Metrics Reported
- `planner`, `status`, `iterations`
- `expanded_nodes`, `generated_nodes`
- `expanded_forward`, `expanded_backward`
- `generated_forward`, `generated_backward`
- `frontier_peak`, `meeting_node`
- `path_cost`, `elapsed_ms`

## Notes For Integration
- Assumes occupancy convention: `0` is free; non-zero is blocked.
- Assumes rectangular grid with uniform edge cost and 4-connected moves.
- Returns deterministic results due to fixed neighbor expansion order.
