# R8 Coordination Log

## Scope Ownership
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r8_fringe_search.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R8_fringe_search.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R8.md`

## Completed
- Added runnable Fringe Search planner:
  - `plan_fringe_search(grid, start, goal) -> (path, metrics)`
- Implemented deterministic 4-connected expansion with Manhattan heuristic.
- Added robust validation and explicit failure statuses.
- Added benchmark metrics payload:
  - `status`, `iterations`, `expanded_nodes`, `generated_nodes`,
    `reopened_nodes`, `threshold_history`, `path_cost`, `elapsed_ms`,
    plus fringe-size diagnostics.
- Added research summary describing when Fringe Search can outperform standard A*.

## Assumptions for Integration
- Coordinates are `(row, col)`.
- `0`/falsy cells are free.
- Non-zero/truthy cells or common wall tokens (`#`, `x`, `wall`, etc.) are blocked.
- Motion model is 4-connected with unit edge cost.

## Output Contract
- Success: returns full path from start to goal (inclusive) and metrics with `status == "ok"`.
- No path: returns `[]` and metrics with `status == "no_path"`.
- Invalid input: returns `[]` and metrics with `status == "invalid_input"` and `error`.
