# R5 Status: Jump Point Search (JPS)

## Scope Owned
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r5_jump_point_search.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R5_jump_point_search.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R5.md`

## Delivered
- Implemented `plan_jps(grid, start, goal)` as a practical 4-connected JPS variant.
- Returns full path and detailed metrics for benchmarking.
- Added research notes with algorithm rationale and caveats.

## Benchmark Expectations
Against plain A* on the same 4-connected uniform-cost grids:
- Corridor-heavy mazes with obstacle-induced chokepoints:
  - Expect fewer expansions (often materially lower, commonly around 1.5x to 4x fewer expanded states).
  - Runtime should usually improve correspondingly.
- Highly open maps with sparse obstacles:
  - Expansion gains may shrink.
  - Runtime can be similar to A* or only modestly better due to jump scanning overhead.
- Dense clutter with frequent short dead-ends:
  - Still generally competitive, but gains depend on how often jumps terminate early.

## Caveat Reminder
- This is 4-way JPS (no diagonal JPS recursion). It is a practical simplification intended for robust integration speed and deterministic benchmarking.
