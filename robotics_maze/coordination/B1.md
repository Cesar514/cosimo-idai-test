# B1 Progress Log

## 2026-02-26 19:40 UTC
- Confirmed ownership scope and checked current repository state.
- Found that `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `src/main.py`, and `coordination/B1.md` were missing and needed fresh scaffold creation.

## 2026-02-26 19:43 UTC
- Added packaging and CLI entrypoint wiring in `pyproject.toml`.
- Added baseline dependencies in `requirements.txt` (`numpy`, `pybullet`) to align with project compatibility goals.

## 2026-02-26 19:45 UTC
- Implemented minimal runnable CLI in `src/main.py`.
- Added argparse flags:
  - `--planner`
  - `--episodes`
  - `--maze-size`
  - `--seed`
  - `--gui`
- Implemented modular component loading with fallback stubs:
  - Maze generator: tries `maze.create_maze_generator`, `maze_generator.create_maze_generator`, `maze_math.create_maze_generator`.
  - Simulator: tries `sim.create_simulator`, `simulation.create_simulator`, `simulator.create_simulator`.
  - Planner:
    - `stub`/`default` uses internal stub planner.
    - Otherwise tries `alt_planners.<name>.create_planner`, `alt_planners.<name>.Planner`, or `<name>.create_planner`.
    - Also supports explicit `module:symbol` via `--planner`.
- CLI remains runnable even when modules from B2/B3/B4 are not present.

## Integration TODOs
- B2 should expose a maze generator factory compatible with:
  - `create_maze_generator() -> object with generate(episode: int, size: tuple[int, int], seed: int | None)`
- B3 should expose a simulator factory compatible with:
  - `create_simulator() -> object with run_episode(maze, plan, gui: bool, seed: int | None) -> EpisodeResult-like`
- B4 planners should expose one of:
  - `create_planner(name: str | None = None)` or
  - `Planner` class (default-constructible or accepts planner name)
- Once B2/B3/B4 land, replace stubs by implementing concrete modules and matching factory names above for zero-touch CLI integration.

## Current Status
- B1 deliverables complete and runnable with stubbed interfaces.
