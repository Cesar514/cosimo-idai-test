# R4 Coordination Log

## Scope Ownership
- `robotics_maze/src/alt_planners/r4_idastar.py`
- `robotics_maze/research/R4_idastar.md`
- `robotics_maze/coordination/R4.md`

## Completed
- Added runnable IDA* planner function:
  - `plan_idastar(grid, start, goal) -> (path, metrics)`
- Added deterministic neighbor ordering for repeatable benchmarks.
- Added metrics payload for cross-planner comparison:
  - `status`, `iterations`, `expanded_nodes`, `generated_nodes`,
    `max_depth`, `threshold_history`, `path_cost`, `runtime_ms`, `elapsed_ms`
- Added direct module smoke-run block (`python .../r4_idastar.py`).
- Added research summary with labyrinth-specific performance expectations.

## Assumptions for Integration
- `grid[r][c] == 0` is free, non-zero is blocked.
- Coordinates are `(row, col)`.
- Motion model is 4-connected with unit step cost.

## Output Contract
- Success: returns full path from start to goal (inclusive) and metrics with `status == "ok"`.
- No path: returns `[]` and metrics with `status == "no_path"`.
- Invalid input: returns `[]` and metrics with `status == "invalid_input"` and `error`.
