## What Each Issue Should Validate

### Issue #1
- Validate all planner recommendations in `robotics_maze/` against repository evidence.
- Classify each method as implemented, partial, docs-only, or missing.
- Provide at least 10 references from 2021+ with relevance summaries.
- Reconcile claims vs implementation reality and propose top remediation steps.

### Issue #2
- Validate all planner recommendations in `robotics_maze/` against repository evidence.
- Classify each method as implemented, partial, docs-only, or missing.
- Provide at least 10 references from 2020 or earlier with relevance summaries.
- Reconcile claims vs implementation reality and propose top remediation steps.

### Issue #5 (Expanded Post-2021)
- Re-run the same verification as #1 with stricter rigor.
- Produce a complete claim-vs-implementation matrix with explicit file-path evidence.
- Provide at least 20 references from 2021+.
- For each reference, include exactly 4 sentences: contribution, relevance, limitation, implementation priority impact.
- Produce prioritized remediation outputs with effort sizing.

### Issue #6 (Expanded Pre-2021)
- Re-run the same verification as #2 with stricter rigor.
- Produce a complete claim-vs-implementation matrix with explicit file-path evidence.
- Provide at least 20 references from 2020 or earlier.
- For each reference, include exactly 4 sentences: contribution, relevance, limitation, implementation priority impact.
- Produce prioritized remediation outputs with effort sizing.

## Backlog Ordering Note

- `#5` is the expanded, stricter version of `#1` (post-2021 track).
- `#6` is the expanded, stricter version of `#2` (pre-2021 track).
- If de-duplicating effort, prioritize `#5` and `#6` first.
