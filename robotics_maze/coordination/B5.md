# B5 Progress Log

## 2026-02-26

1. Added `robotics_maze/scripts/fetch_urdfs.py`, a mac-friendly fetch utility
that supports `git` sparse checkout with archive fallback.
2. Configured two mobile robot URDF sources in the script:
`turtlebot3` (`ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3`, `main`) and `husky`
(`husky/husky`, `noetic-devel`).
3. Script now fetches URDF and mesh paths and writes `SOURCE.json` metadata with
license and usage notes for each source.
4. Added `robotics_maze/scripts/fetch_urdfs.sh` as a shell wrapper over
`python3 fetch_urdfs.py`.
5. Added `robotics_maze/urdfs/README.md` with fetch commands, expected folder
layout, source caveats, and explicit `pybullet_data` fallback guidance.
