## 2. Literature Section (2021-2025 References)

Each reference below includes a 4-sentence justification regarding its contribution, relevance, limitations, and priority influence.

### 2.1 Classical & Incremental Search Enhancements
1. **Fu, X. et al. (2025). "Research on path planning of mobile robots based on improved A* algorithm." PeerJ Computer Science.**
   - The paper introduces an improved A* that incorporates dynamic weight coefficients and bidirectional search to enhance efficiency in complex environments.
   - It is directly relevant to the repository's goal of providing high-performance grid-based baselines beyond standard A*.
   - A potential limitation is that the node deletion strategy might increase computational overhead in extremely sparse maps.
   - This suggests that adding dynamic weight support to the existing `r1_weighted_astar.py` should be a high priority.

2. **MDPI (2025). "Path Planning for Construction Robot Based on the Improved A* Algorithm and BIM."**
   - This research utilizes B-spline curves and dimensional constraints to smooth paths generated by A* in building information models.
   - It provides a modern justification for any-angle approaches like the `r3_theta_star.py` already in the repo.
   - The method depends heavily on structured BIM data, which may not translate well to the repository's generic occupancy grids.
   - It should influence the implementation of a post-smoothing module for all existing grid planners.

3. **PMC (2024). "Research on path planning of mobile robots based on improved bidirectional A* algorithm."**
   - The authors enhance bidirectional A* by extracting key nodes to remove redundant waypoints and useless turn points.
   - This validates the repository's inclusion of `r2_bidirectional_astar.py` while suggesting ways to optimize its output.
   - The strategy for node extraction may struggle with optimality in maps where every grid step is critical.
   - Implementation of a "key node extraction" utility should be prioritized for the next benchmark iteration.

4. **PMC (2022). "The EBS-A* algorithm: An improved A* algorithm for path planning."**
   - EBS-A* combines expansion distance (obstacle clearance), bidirectional search, and path smoothing into a single framework.
   - It supports the repository's "SOTA" research goals by demonstrating significant efficiency gains over vanilla A*.
   - The clearance-based expansion (E) requires preprocessing the grid, which adds to the initial latency.
   - This reference justifies adding a "safety-aware" heuristic option to the current A* implementation.

5. **Li, X. et al. (2023). "Path Planning for Intelligent Vehicles Based on Improved D* Lite." Journal of Supercomputing.**
   - This work addresses the "large corner" and "node redundancy" issues in standard D* Lite by introducing kinematic constraints and Bezier smoothing.
   - It is highly relevant to the `R10` recommendation for D* Lite as a primary dynamic planner.
   - The introduction of kinematic constraints makes the search space much larger and potentially slower for simple grid robots.
   - It reinforces the need to implement D* Lite (currently missing) with built-in smoothing.

6. **Hu, L. et al. (2024). "Path Planning of Inspection Robots Based on Improved D*Lite-APF Algorithm."**
   - The paper merges D* Lite with the Artificial Potential Field (APF) method to improve local obstacle avoidance during global replanning.
   - This provides a theoretical basis for the "DWA + D* Lite" hybrid mentioned in the repo's `r10_dwa_hybrid.md`.
   - APF methods are notoriously prone to local minima, which could trap the robot even with D* Lite guidance.
   - This should influence the repository to include APF as a comparison baseline for local control.

7. **Fu, L. et al. (2023). "Continuous Dynamic Planning Algorithm for 2D Paths Based on Improved D* Lite."**
   - This research focuses on real-time continuous path updates as new obstacles are sensed in a 2D environment.
   - It justifies the repo's focus on dynamic map handling and incremental search in `R6` and `R10`.
   - The "continuous" aspect requires high-frequency sensing updates that may outpace Python's performance without optimization.
   - It highlights the importance of benchmarking D* Lite against LPA* in the repository's `B6` harness.

8. **Wu, T. et al. (2022). "Path Planning for Mobile Robots Using Improved D*Lite and Time Elastic Band Methods."**
   - The authors fuse D* Lite for global planning with the Time Elastic Band (TEB) approach for local trajectory optimization.
   - This is a direct parallel to the repository's recommendation to pair SOTA planners with local controllers like DWA.
   - TEB is computationally intensive compared to the simpler DWA proposed in the integration notes.
   - It suggests that the repository should eventually move toward TEB if DWA performance is insufficient.

### 2.2 Advanced & Multi-Heuristic Search
9. **Natarajan, R. et al. (2025). "A-MHA*: Anytime Multi-Heuristic A*." arXiv.**
   - A-MHA* transforms the Multi-Heuristic A* algorithm into an anytime planner that improves solution quality over time.
   - It represents the current state-of-the-art for the "Anytime" and "MHA*" recommendations in `R10`.
   - The algorithm is complex to implement and requires careful management of multiple open lists and consistency sets.
   - This should be the target implementation for the "Second Phase" of the repository's SOTA upgrades.

10. **Christen et al. (2025). "MHA* with dynamic or mutable heuristics." Emergent Mind.**
    - This paper establishes the formal conditions for "dynamic consistency" when heuristics change during the search.
    - It is relevant for advanced scenarios where the robot's understanding of the environment evolves rapidly.
    - The mathematical overhead of maintaining dynamic consistency may not be necessary for simple maze tasks.
    - It serves as a safety/correctness reference if the repository implements learning-augmented heuristics.

11. **Saxena et al. (2021). "AMRA*: Anytime Multi-Resolution Multi-Heuristic A*."**
    - AMRA* combines coarse and fine grid resolutions with multiple heuristics to accelerate search in large environments.
    - It addresses the scalability issues of grid planners that the repository's benchmarks may encounter.
    - Multi-resolution grids require more complex data structures than the current flat 2D arrays.
    - This suggests that a multi-resolution grid utility should be a medium-term priority for the `src/maze.py` module.

12. **Wang, H. et al. (2024). "IBPF-RRT*: An improved path planning algorithm with Ultra-low number of iterations." Journal of King Saud University.**
    - This paper introduces an Intelligent Bi-Probability Field (IBPF) to guide RRT* sampling, achieving faster convergence with fewer iterations.
    - It is highly relevant for the repository's SOTA section as it demonstrates how to combine field-based guidance with sampling planners.
    - The ultra-low iteration count may come at the cost of higher per-iteration geometric field calculations.
    - It justifies prioritizing sampling-based planners that use grid-based pre-processing or "potential fields" for guidance.

### 2.3 Sampling & Hybrid Methods
13. **Yin, X. et al. (2024). "Route planning of mobile robot based on improved RRT star and TEB algorithm." PMC.**
    - The paper improves RRT* by using a goal-biased sampling strategy and TEB smoothing to find better paths faster.
    - It provides a modern context for the `Hybrid-RRT*` recommendation in the repository's SOTA list.
    - Sampling-based methods still suffer from high variance in narrow corridors compared to the repo's grid searchers.
    - This reinforces the idea that RRT* should remain a secondary "continuous" option rather than the primary grid planner.

14. **IJEEE (2024). "Hybrid RRT-A*: An Improved Path Planning Method for Autonomous Mobile Robots."**
    - This hybrid method uses A* heuristics to guide RRT tree expansion, significantly reducing the number of nodes expanded.
    - It is a perfect example of the "Hybrid-RRT*" method listed in `R10_alt_methods_sota.md`.
    - The search space still lacks the deterministic nature of pure grid algorithms, which may affect benchmarking consistency.
    - It should be prioritized as the first sampling-based method to be implemented in `src/alt_planners/`.

15. **Yin, X. et al. (2023). "Dynamic Path Planning of AGV Based on Kinematical Constraint A* and DWA." Sensors.**
    - The authors fuse a kinematically constrained A* with DWA to handle dynamic obstacles in factory environments.
    - This validates the "DWA Hybrid" approach described in `r10_dwa_hybrid.md`.
    - Kinematic constraints are specific to the robot model and may limit the generality of the repository's planners.
    - This should lead to the implementation of a basic `dwa.py` controller that can ingest paths from the existing A* modules.

### 2.4 Learning & Local Control Enhancements
16. **Su, K. et al. (2025). "Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance Path Planning by Integrating Improved A* and DWA." Preprints.**
    - This recent work optimizes the A* and DWA fusion for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in real-time scenarios.
    - It serves as the most current evidence for the effectiveness of the repository's proposed hybrid architecture.
    - The "Real-Time" guarantee is highly dependent on the underlying hardware and C++/Python implementation details.
    - It supports the high priority of the `remediation-step-2` (DWA implementation).

17. **Cheng et al. (2024). "Enhancing Obstacle Avoidance in DWA via Dynamic Obstacle Behavior Prediction." MDPI.**
    - This research integrates a prediction mechanism into DWA to estimate future positions of moving obstacles.
    - It addresses the "Missing DWA" gap in the repository with a high-performance modern variant.
    - Behavior prediction requires a temporal map or object tracking, which is currently beyond the repository's scope.
    - This reference justifies future work on a "Dynamic Obstacle" simulator in `src/sim.py`.

18. **ELSP (2024). "Learning Based Robot Path and Task Planning." Special Issue.**
    - This collection highlights the impact of LLMs and deep reinforcement learning on augmenting traditional planners like A*.
    - It validates the "Learning-Augmented" recommendation (`LoHA*`) in the SOTA research file.
    - LLM-based planning is still experimental and often lacks the formal guarantees of the repository's classical planners.
    - It should influence the repository to provide an "Expert Demonstration" exporter to support future imitation learning.

19. **arXiv (2025). "Efficient Hierarchical Any-Angle Path Planning on Multi-Resolution 3D Grids."**
    - While focused on 3D, this paper provides updated bounds and efficiency metrics for any-angle algorithms like Theta*.
    - It confirms that any-angle planning remains a critical area of active research in 2025.
    - The hierarchical approach is complex and might be overkill for the repository's current 2D benchmarks.
    - It supports the continued maintenance and benchmarking of the `r3_theta_star.py` module.

20. **Cao, L. et al. (2025). "Smooth Optimized A*-Guided DWA for Mobile Robot Path Planning." Applied Sciences.**
    - This paper proposes an "Optimized A*" that pre-calculates the safest path segments for DWA to follow.
    - It represents the state-of-the-art in "Planner-Guided Local Control" as of early 2025.
    - The safety optimization may result in much longer paths compared to the repository's current "shortest-path" focus.
    - It justifies adding a "Clearance" parameter to the global planners in `src/planners.py`.

### Top 5 Mismatches & Remediation

| ID | Mismatch | Priority | Remediation Step | Effort |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **D* Lite missing** | Critical | Implement `src/alt_planners/r10_dstar_lite.py` based on Koenig (2002) and Li (2023). | **M** |
| **2** | **DWA missing** | High | Create `src/alt_planners/dwa_controller.py` to enable the "Hybrid Loop" described in R10. | **M** |

### Summary Analysis
The repository is highly consistent in its "Classical" and "Alternative" planner implementations (R1-R9), with 100% of these methods backed by Python code. However, there is a significant "SOTA gap" where the most advanced recommendations (D* Lite, AD*, MHA*) only exist as documentation. Modern literature (2021-2025) confirms that these missing methods are current industry standards for dynamic robot navigation, making their implementation the highest priority for future development.
