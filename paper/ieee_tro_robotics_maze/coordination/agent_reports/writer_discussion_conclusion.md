# Discussion + Conclusion Writer Report

## Scope
- Owned files:
  - `paper/ieee_tro_robotics_maze/sections/07_discussion.tex`
  - `paper/ieee_tro_robotics_maze/sections/08_conclusion.tex`
  - `paper/ieee_tro_robotics_maze/coordination/agent_reports/writer_discussion_conclusion.md`

## What I Added
- Drafted a full Discussion section grounded in repository evidence (benchmark summary, planner inventory, simulator capabilities).
- Added an explicit status split for methods:
  - Implemented and benchmarked.
  - Implemented but not in the current benchmark summary.
  - Not-yet-implemented directions.
- Added a dedicated subsection titled `Aggressive Forward-Looking Hypotheses` with four hypotheses, each using an explicit `Hypothesis / Risk / Validation plan` structure.
- Drafted a concise Conclusion that:
  - Recaps what is currently demonstrated.
  - Separates implemented capabilities from roadmap items.
  - States the next empirical gate for future claims.

## Notes
- Content is intentionally constrained to claims traceable to current repository artifacts and code paths.
- No changes were made outside owned files.
