\section{Conclusion}

This manuscript stage delivers a reproducible baseline for maze-navigation planning with explicit evidence from code and benchmark artifacts. In the current snapshot, 12 implemented planners solve all 50 static $15\times15$ benchmark mazes, with \texttt{r1\_weighted\_astar} leading runtime and \texttt{r4\_idastar} showing the highest computational burden. The implemented system is strongest today as a controlled occupancy-grid comparison and simulation harness (backend fallback, URDF robustness, and deterministic visual-regression support), not yet as a fully dynamic or kinodynamically realistic planner stack.

Method scope is therefore explicit: classical and alternative grid-search planners are implemented and benchmarked, while LoHA-style learned heuristics, D* Lite/AD* + DWA coupling, SE(2) Hybrid-A* or IGHA*, guided RRT*, and uncertainty-aware MPC remain not-yet-implemented research directions. The next milestone is to convert these forward hypotheses into acceptance-tested experiments with dynamic obstacles, larger maps, and feasibility-oriented metrics so future claims are supported by statistically grounded evidence rather than extrapolation.
